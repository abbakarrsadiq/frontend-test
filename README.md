Features

Responsive Design: The UI is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
Interactive Elements: Implemented interactive elements as per the design (e.g., buttons, links).
Accessibility: Ensured accessibility features are included (e.g., alt texts for images, ARIA roles).

Implementation Details

HTML

The HTML file contains the structure of the web page, including headers, footers, and main content sections. Semantic HTML tags are used for better accessibility and SEO.

CSS

The styles are written in CSS, following a mobile-first approach. Flexbox and Grid layouts are used to create a responsive design. Custom properties (CSS variables) are used for maintaining a consistent color scheme.

React js

React JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the page. For example, event listeners are added to buttons for handling user interactions.

Challenges
 Constraint: Completing the task within the 24-hour window was challenging because I was already engaged with some tasks and greatly preoccupied but I'm fully commited to this opportunity and would like the opportunity to prove myself..
 Responsiveness: Ensuring the design looked good on various devices required thorough testing and adjustments.

Conclusion

This task was a great opportunity to demonstrate my frontend skills. I have ensured that the implementation is faithful to the Figma design and meets the requirements outlined in the task description.
